# To-do

Releases need vigerous testing - kinda wip, ReleaseDef - Update

A push is when someone has multiple commits and they do a git push (to a branch), it can be multiple sub-commits

Rollback a commit? Tricky...

Update the state file on startup, and have an option to disable it - DONE
Maybe add the alternative way? I.E. if it's changed in real resources

Script plan mode?

Teams.get_members(recursive=True)  Not sure that Teams are the right thing, maybe Groups? Idk

We can maybe use run id to delete all by run id? "prevent_destroy", "ignore_changes"
MORE WORK ON LIFECYCLE!

We need to do something differently with creating stuff, currently if you run the same script twice, it'll just error because the
object already exists, so the creator in SMR should check try, and if it fails, update the already existing one?

This?

Dataclass "init=False" part of a field, but this won't work for type hinting I guess, also, while things like
normally take 1 input (id), things like create can take more complicated stuff

Service connections perms on pipelines (done, not tested)

Commits/Branches are the only things that don't have a generic `get_all`

Pipeline perms, currently our pipelines are approval-able by almost anyone, we should be able to set the perms

AdoUser - Get all, doesn't work with pagination

Maybe rather than RepoContextManager, we have it work for all resources? Maybe takes any StateManaged Resource and deletes it after?
Make all resources be able to be context managers?
This would work great (I think), but the objects need to store the ado_client, because exiting requires it...

TestStateManager needs some work
Hmmmmm, it appears that when creating a variable group, it doesn't return the created by or modified by with enough data.
This is different from the get_by_id, because the get_by_id gets the creator, but the creation return doesn't...

build_defs/allow_on_environment Needs testing

The problem we have with the whole "create twice" instead of update can be fixed.
The state stores the repo id, but it also stores the repo *name*, which is coincidentally also unique.
Most resources have names, or some definining values which has to be unique, e.g. name (in repos, variable groups, etc).
Tags are a problem, branches a bit too, build definitions too, the problem is that we want to be able to change things and
have the create update, rather than create, but if the data is different, how do we link them?  

Searches tests (extend)  
More tests around runs
AgentPools create/delete and testing  
AuditLogs Tests  
Test state_manager.py more?  
Test __main__.py  

Get `get_my_pull_requests` of pull request to check if the status is int, if so convert  

Pull Request merge_status seem pointless tbh, they're almost always 2 or 3.

Set "My Pull Request" config, maybe at <https://dev.azure.com/VFCloudEngineering/_api/_versioncontrol/updateUserPreferences?__v=5>
